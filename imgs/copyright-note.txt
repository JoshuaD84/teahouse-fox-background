Please note that these images do not belong to me. 

I did not create them. I believe the artists that 
collaborate under the name "meomi" (www.meomi.com)
created these images.  I do not know who they belong
to, but I assume they are public domain, as they are 
freely available for download from multiple sites 
that I found easily using public search tools. 

However, if I am mistake and if you are the artist 
or copyright holder of these images and you do not 
approve of their inclusion on this git repsitory, 
please simply contact me and I will be glad to remove 
them. (In this event, I would implore you to consider
the warmth and happiness seeing this adorable fox
go about its peaceful daily routine can bring for
many people, and ask you to reconsider your request,
but just contact me and I'll respect your wishes.)

As another note: if you are the artist that created
these images, would you be interested in a commission
to create additional images in this style and with
these characters?  I think it would be swell to have
a handful of different images for each time slot
available to be randomly displayed each day.  This
way, the fox has different random adventures every day.

Please contact me if that sounds awesome to you, too!
